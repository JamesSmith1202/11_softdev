    <h1 class="header">Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!</h1>
    <p>Actually, that's still true. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! I don't know what you did, Fry, but
        once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.</p>
    <p>No, just a regular mistake. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Who are you, my warranty?!
        <strong> Ah, yes!</strong>
        <em> John Quincy Adding Machine.</em> He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</p>
    <h2 class="header">I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes
        with double prize money.</h2>
    <p>Kif might! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come
        you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>And when we woke up, we had these bodies.</li>
        <li>Meh.</li>
        <li>Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="header">For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.</h3>
    <p>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Oh, how awful. Did he at least
        die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!</li>
        <li>Anyone who laughs is a communist!</li>
        <li>I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Who are you, my warranty?! Can we have Bender Burgers again? Also Zoidberg. Daylight and everything.</p>
    <p>I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind
        of cheesy New Year's costume? A true inspiration for the children. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and
        impatient?</p>
    <p>A true inspiration for the children. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Maybe I love
        you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your
        skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.</p>
    <p>Hello, little man. I will destroy you! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? You mean while
        I'm sleeping in it? For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.</p>
    <p>I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! We're also Santa Claus! I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!
        But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.</p>
    <p>Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made
        it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Bender, quit destroying the universe!</p>
    <p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! I didn't ask for a completely reasonable
        excuse! I asked you to get busy! Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put
        on your good vestments."</p>
    <p>Really?! If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. I just want to talk. It has nothing
        to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.</p>
    <p>What are their names? Who are you, my warranty?! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. She also liked to shut up! It's
        just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter,
        while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died,
        and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>
    <p>Soon enough. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. No, she'll probably make me do it. For example, if you killed
        your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!</p>
    <p>For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. What's with you
        kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.</p>
